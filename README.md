## Immigrants Helper

**Problem Statement** : 

After arriving in a foreign country many times immigrants face difficulties in securing the work, raising the children and accessing the services due to lack of knowledge of the procedure being followed on that land. Then they seek help on the web which takes many hours to find the relevant and best answers.

**Abstract** : 

To mitigate above stated problem build a web application to help the new immigrants to know about the procedure being followed to acquire a certain type of visa, SSN, etc. using the chatbot.

**Approach** :

The NLP model is pretained with the questions and answers asked previously related to the immigrations and procedure post landing in the US using the selected website scraping using python libraries BeautifulSoup, Scarpy. The user will ask the question using the chatbot and if that related question is previously asked then the NLP model will generate the response. If the question is very specific and unique or the user wants to know detailed procedure then the web app gives the list of experts resides in the nearby area the user can contact personally and can contact through on the same web platform. 

**Persona** :

US immigrants 

**Dataset** : 

Most of the frequently asked questions and answers can be found by scraping the Quota, Reddit etc.. . For the detailed or specific questions, the user will be contacted to the experts. 



## Student Parking Lot

**Problem Statement** : 

Finding parking for student sometimes hard and students need to know if the parking is available for them during their class and if not , they can schedule their time to arrange commute with public transportation. Knowing parking availability before hand and ability to reserve parking with their class time frame would save a lot of time for them and also reducing stress.


**Abstract** :

Design an app or web portal for students to be able automate browsing and finding the empty parking spot and reserve. The app can be updated in real time and shows how many parking are available on the guidance map.

The user can automatically calculate the fee and user can pay the fees at the time of leaving. The app can generate the bar code for user to pay at leaving time. If user want to reserve in advance, he should pay and reserve the spot before arrival and when the user reserve the spot, the spot color changes to red and nobody can reserve that spot again until the color changes to white.


**Approach** : 

This app can be added advanced features in future and connect to IOT as an input and be able to sync with google maps and can be usable for public at the time of intelligent cities. 


**Persona** :

SJSU Student

**Dataset** : 

Can be achieved by university parking layout and numbers dedicated to each spot. Need to design the same layout in the app. Users have ability to register and insert their student information such as their names, Student ID,  their payment info ,â€¦.



## Firearm Analysis

**Problem Statement** :

Find the correlation between firearms and crime using various factors related to the data by performing an analysis on them.

 
**Abstract**

There are several studies that show that there is a correlation between the prevalence of gun ownership and an increase in  certain types of crime. Whether this association is attributable to firearm sales causing more crime is unclear. AN important limitation is the lack of measure of gun ownership. Thus we can try to map the various properties related to these firearms to the types of crimes in an area.  We can even include the number of public safety officers and arrests related to this data. An analysis can be done on all these factors by trying to map these relations. We can then show the analysis between various factors and how each factor affects the results differently. Thus the user can draw their own conclusions based on the dataset and the types of factors he is mapping.

 
**Approach**

We can find several suitable datasets online and use them to do our analysis. We can merge several attributes of the datasets and eliminate values not needed using appropriate methods. The analysis can be shown in a visual manner using suitable graphs.
